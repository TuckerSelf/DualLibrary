 * @brief Group Library Assignment
 * 
 * The library system allows for computer documentation of book inventory complete with the ability to add
 *  and remove books and thier information at the user's discretion. It also allows for the searching of
 *  specific authors and thier works with either a simple book title view or a detailed information view.
 * 
 * Work was split up evenly between the two parties involved in this program's making with each designer
 *  working on separate files and implementing thier own ideas while offering feedback to one another.
